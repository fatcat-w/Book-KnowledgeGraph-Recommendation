    "For the complete CNN-RNN model, see **model.py**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For the encoder model, we use a pre-trained ResNet which has been known to achieve great success in image classification. We use batch normalization because according to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) it \"allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. We will set it to `32`.\n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  A larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary. We will set it to `5` just like [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)\n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. This will be changed to `True` once we are done setting `vocab_threshold` and generating a `vocab.pkl` file.\n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings. We have tried `512` as done in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) but it took a long time to train, so I will set it to `256`.\n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder. We will use `512` based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf). The larger the number, the better the RNN model can memorize sequences. However, larger numbers can significantly slow down the training process.\n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We are dealing with a huge amount of data so it will take a long time to complete even 1 epoch. Therefore, we will set `num_epochs` to `1`. We will save the model AND the optimizer every 100 training steps, and to resume training from the last step."
